Gesture Control System using Python 🖐️💻
Control your laptop mouse cursor and system functions using your hand gestures captured via webcam!
This project uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI, and Kalman Filter for ultra-smooth motion tracking.

🚀 Features

Feature	Description
🖱️ Mouse Control	Move mouse dynamically with your index finger
🔈 Volume Control	Control system volume using hand gestures
📷 Screenshot	Capture the screen with a "V" gesture
📜 Scroll Pages	Scroll webpages using swipe gestures
🔐 Lock Screen	Lock your device using a closed fist gesture
🔌 Sleep Mode	Put laptop to sleep using flat palm
🧠 App Launch	Launch specific apps via hand gestures
🧹 Kalman Filter	Smooth and predictive mouse movement filtering
📸 Demo

🎯 Future Upgrades
Add multi-hand support (e.g., dual hand gestures).

Use deep learning to improve gesture recognition.

Custom app launchers based on gestures.

Integrate voice feedback ("Volume Increased", "Screenshot Taken").
